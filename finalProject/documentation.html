        <h3>Project Summary:</h3>
        <li>
            Time is Key! is a simple platformer game where you control a character and race to obtain 3 different keys and unlock the door to escape.
            Keys are randomly placed each run, and time is tracked per run.
        </li>
        <h3>Graphics:</h3>
        <li>
            For the Graphics implementation this project utilizes a character spritesheet from Spriter's Resource that originates from ConcernedApe's Stardew Valley,
            it also makes use of a couple of tilesets found on itch.io from contributers that offered the assets for free. Contributers are credited in the resource section below.
            This project also includes key sprites that were actually made by myself using Piskel.

        <h3>Sounds:</h3>
        <li>
            For the Sounds implementation I created extremely basic background music that consists of a couple of looping notes, and some mp3 assets pulled from the Tone.JS examples,
            these sounds include the snare drum, snare.mp3, and the base kick, kick.mp3. I also included sounds when the player interacts with some of the assets in the level. 
            These sounds involve an mp3 for a door locking sound, and another mp3 for the ladder climbs. All assets taken were from open source web sites.

        <h3>Hardware/Serial Communication</h3>
        <li>
            For the Hardware implementation of this project I allowed the player to control the game via an analog joystick with a built in digital button. The joystick is used for
            maneuvering a sprite through the level, and the button is used to interact with the main screen and all interactable assets within the game. 
            The p5.js sketch communicates with an Arduino Uno to send signals that turns on LEDs based on what color key is collected by the player.
